Just shipped my Stage 3 project for the @hnginternship! I built an AI Decision Note Agent with Python, FastAPI, and the @teleximapp A2A protocol.

It turns chaotic team chats into structured, searchable decision logs. No more "what did we decide?" moments!

HNG is not for the weak!!

The last couple of weeks have been a deep dive into the world of AI agents, APIs, and real-time communication as part of the HNG Internship. For my Stage 3 project, I built a Decision Note Agent, and I'm thrilled with how it turned out.

**The Problem:** Important decisions get lost in the noise of team chats.

**The Solution:** An AI-powered agent built with Python and FastAPI that integrates with Telex.im. The agent listens for commands to propose, vote on, and log team decisions, creating a single source of truth.

This project was a fantastic learning experience, especially when it came to implementing the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, debugging asynchronous tasks, and thinking about how AI can practically solve everyday team frustrations.

Key takeaways:
- FastAPI's async capabilities are a lifesaver for chat applications.
- A well-defined protocol like A2A is crucial for interoperability between different platforms.
- Sometimes, the most impactful AI isn't the most complex, but the one that solves the most common problems.

I've written a detailed blog post about the process, the challenges, and the "aha!" moments. You can read it here: [Link to your dev.to post]

A huge thank you to the HNG mentors for pushing us to build practical, real-world applications. On to the next stage!
